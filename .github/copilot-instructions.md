# Copilot Instructions for HTML/CSS Learning Project

## Project Context
This is a beginner-focused HTML/CSS learning workspace with educational materials and progressive exercises. The student "Wannes" is learning web development through hands-on projects, progressing from basic HTML to advanced CSS techniques.

## Architecture Overview

## Student Learning Path & Progress Tracking
When working with this codebase, **always check `.copilot-instructions.md`** in the active project folder for:
- Current skill level and completed steps
- What concepts the student has/hasn't learned yet
- Active learning objectives and next steps
- Teaching constraints (NO direct solutions - guide only)

### Current Learning State (Opdracht 2) - Updated 28 Sept 2025
- âœ… **CSS Variables MASTERED**: Created comprehensive variable system (colors, shadows, transitions)
- âœ… **CSS Grid Layout MASTERED**: Responsive grid with auto-fit, minmax(), gap
- âœ… **Card Components MASTERED**: Professional styling with backgrounds, borders, shadows
- âœ… **Advanced Selectors MASTERED**: Multiple class combinations (.card.github, etc.)
- âœ… **Transform & Transitions MASTERED**: Hover effects with translateY(), smooth transitions
- âœ… **Multi-Property Hover Effects MASTERED**: Combined transform + enhanced shadows
- âœ… **Responsive Images MASTERED**: Flexible sizing with width: 100%
- ðŸŽ¯ **READY FOR**: Responsive design with media queries (next major concept)

## Educational Methodology
1. **Step-by-step progression**: One concept per lesson
2. **Theory before practice**: Explain WHY before HOW  
3. **No direct solutions**: Provide hints and guidance, never complete code
4. **Validate each step**: Check implementation before advancing
5. **Build understanding**: Connect new concepts to previously learned material

## Key Project Patterns

### CSS Learning Progression
1. **Basic styling** â†’ **Hover effects** â†’ **Layout systems** â†’ **Advanced effects**
2. **CSS Variables** for consistent theming across projects
3. **Modern layout** with Grid/Flexbox over legacy techniques
4. **Progressive enhancement** from simple to complex interactions

### Teaching-Focused Code Structure
- Each project builds incrementally on previous knowledge
- CSS organized by learning complexity, not functionality
- Comments explain educational concepts, not just implementation
- Demo files show "what's possible" without overwhelming beginners

### Reference Materials Usage
The `CSS-Demos/` folder contains advanced examples to:
- Show final goals and professional techniques
- Provide copy-paste free inspiration
- Demonstrate modern CSS capabilities
- Serve as reference for teaching complex concepts

## Development Workflow
1. **Check learning state**: Always read project-specific instructions first
2. **Validate current code**: Understand what student has implemented
3. **Guide incrementally**: Teach one property/concept at a time
4. **Test understanding**: Have student implement changes manually
5. **Update progress**: Note completed steps in instructions file

## Common Student Challenges
- **Syntax confusion**: Missing semicolons, incorrect property names
- **Transform combinations**: Forgetting spaces between multiple transforms
- **CSS specificity**: Rules not applying due to selector weight
- **Box model understanding**: Padding/margin/border relationships
- **Layout debugging**: Grid/flexbox behavior troubleshooting

Remember: This is an educational environment - prioritize learning over perfect code.
